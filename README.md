1. The [***Golden Rule***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule): Treat others as you would like others to treat you.

2. **Be happy.** We like to surround ourselves with great people so good vibes are mandatory (read: almost unavoidable).

3. **If someone is doing something offensive, hurtful or that is damaging your (and others') productivity, ask them to stop.** They probably don't even realise they're doing so, just be nice about it.

4. **If someone asks you nicely to _stop_ doing something, _stop_.** They're coming from a good place.

5. **Be human.** Behave like a ~~decent~~ *awesome* human being, as if someone you respect is always around!

6. **Be respectful of other people's working hours.** People may be working when you're relaxing and vice versa so keep that in mind, whether you're chatting loudly in the same physical space as them or getting impatient about the resolution of an issue!

7. **Always be learning or teaching.**

8. **Be curious.** Got a question? *Ask* people on their breaks. Found the prettiest flower you ever did see? Point it out! Take time to explore, discover and draw inspiration from your everyday.

9. **We're here to help!** If there's anything you need, just ask!

10. **Take & Share lots of photos**: Please take lots of lovely photos (*and videos*!) and post them to your favourite social networks. We love seeing people _do what they love_! **#dwyl**    
(*always ask for people's permission before posting a photo of them*)

### Working with us in person
We would of course like to think everyone does this stuff even when they're not working in the same physical place as us, but here's how we like to do things.

11. **Be tidy.** Common sense/courtesy apply here - always clean any mess on counters/floors, wash dishes/cutlery you use and leave things as you find them (or better!).

12. **Keep the noise levels down.** Avoid being super loud, especially during the group's established working hours.

13. **Recycle**. Always separate waste into recyclable and non-recyclable. If in doubt, *ask*!

14. **Buy/Use/Wear _Sun Screen_**: If you're [working with us in Portugal](https://github.com/dwyl/summer), remember the sun is strong, you _will_ burn if you aren't careful!
